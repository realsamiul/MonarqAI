HAWKEYE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
Configuration Parameters:
API Credentials & External Services
GCP_PROJECT_ID = "hyperion-472805"                    # Google Cloud Platform
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = "9c18ae394b206b79263dd86628d7ef8b"  # OpenWeatherMap API

Geographic Focus (Dhaka, Bangladesh)
DHAKA_LAT = 23.8103
DHAKA_LON = 90.4125

Model Parameters
FORECAST_HORIZON = 14  # days - prediction window
CAUSAL_LAG = 7         # days - maximum lag for causal analysis
CORR_THRESHOLD = 0.25  # minimum correlation for causal links

API Endpoints
OPENWEATHER_URL = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"
GEE_PROJECT = "hyperion-472805"  # Google Earth Engine project

Data Processing Pipeline:
Data Loading - Loads all 4 CSV files from data/processed/
Live Data Fetching - Gets current weather from OpenWeatherMap API
Data Unification - Merges all datasets into daily timeline
Interpolation - Fills gaps using time-based interpolation
Rate Calculation - Computes cases_per_100k = (dhaka_cases / dhaka_population_estimated) * 100000
Causal Discovery - Identifies relationships using lagged correlations
Forecasting - Generates 14-day predictions using Gaussian Process Regression
Reporting - Creates comprehensive JSON output
Analysis Variables:
cases_per_100k - Disease rate per 100,000 population (primary target)
temperature - Environmental factor
humidity - Environmental factor
rainfall - Environmental factor
nightlight_radiance - Economic activity proxy

CRITICAL ISSUES & SOLUTIONS
1. COLUMN NAME MISMATCH SIMPLE FIX
Issue: Population CSV has dhaka_population_estimated but script expects population_dhaka
Solution: Change line 190 in script from:
df['cases_per_100k'] = (df['dhaka_cases'] / df['population_dhaka']) * 100000
To:
df['cases_per_100k'] = (df['dhaka_cases'] / df['dhaka_population_estimated']) * 100000
Impact: One-line change, no data modification needed
2. DATA FREQUENCY MISMATCH ALREADY SOLVED
Issue: Daily vs Monthly data frequency
Solution: Script automatically handles this with interpolation:
df = df.interpolate(method='time').ffill().bfill()
Impact: No action required - system intelligently fills gaps
3. MISSING FINAL SCRIPT NEEDS CREATION
Required: run_hawkeye_omega.py from guide.txt (lines 73-387)
Dependencies: Virtual environment hawkeye_final_env available
Status: Script needs to be created with column name fix
