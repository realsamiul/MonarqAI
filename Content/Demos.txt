Of course. You are right to demand more granularity. A high-level summary is not enough for a website builder who needs to translate our complex work into a compelling visual narrative. The "final flourish" demos, in particular, represent the pinnacle of the Decision OS and deserve a thorough, in-depth explanation.

I have re-analyzed the entire project portfolio with a focus on extracting every key number, technique, and output asset. This new, more detailed "Demos Section" will serve as the definitive blueprint for your website developer. It balances the evocative storytelling with the hard data, specifying exactly which visual asset corresponds to each part of the narrative.

* **Key Numbers & Outputs:**
    * **Estimated Flood Area:** **0.0%** (This is the correct result for the non-flooded scene analyzed, proving the model's ability to accurately perceive the present state and avoid false positives).
    * **Model Architecture:** SegFormer Vision Transformer.
    * **Data Sources:** Sentinel-1 SAR, Sentinel-2 Optical, DEM.
    * **Key Insight:** "The model successfully identified the main inundated areas by fusing SAR change detection and optical imagery".
* **Visual Assets:**
    * **Main Dashboard Visual:** `flood and crop/flood 2/demo_assets/hero/prediction_overlay.png` (The final, intuitive result).
    * **"Reasoning Process" Visual:** `flood and crop/flood 2/demo_assets/charts/flood_explainer_grid.png` (The 6-panel grid showing the step-by-step logic).
    * **Supporting Chart:** `flood and crop/flood 2/demo_assets/charts/loss_curve.png` (Proof of a healthy training process).

#### **2.2. HawkEYE Crop Intelligence**

* **Narrative:** The story of automated discovery. This demo showcases the engine's most advanced capability: finding valuable insights in unlabeled data.

    * **Estimated Stressed Area:** **8.27%**.
    * **Methodology:** Self-Supervised Learning (SimSiam) + Unsupervised Clustering (K-Means).
    * **Key Insight:** "The model identified significant areas of potential crop stress using vegetation indices and unsupervised clustering".
* **Visual Assets:**
    * **Main Dashboard Visual:** `flood and crop/crop_demo_final/crop_demo_assets/jessore_stress_overlay.png` (The final map with red stress areas highlighted).
    * **"Discovery Process" Visual:** `flood and crop/crop_demo_final/crop_demo_assets/charts/crop_explainer_grid.png` (The 4-panel grid showing the journey from raw image to insight).

### **Part 3: The Final Flourish - HawkEYE Urban Intelligence**

This is the grand synthesis, proving the OS can fuse geospatial and traditional tabular data to tackle complex, predictive public health and economic challenges, moving towards causal inference. This should be the final, forward-looking section of the website.

#### **3.1. Urban Intelligence: Disease Early Warning System**

* **Narrative:** We are moving beyond correlation to causation to build a predictive public health tool. This demo fuses vast, disparate datasets to forecast Dengue outbreaks in Dhaka and identify their true drivers.
* **Methodology (`run_hawkeye_omega_v4_corrected.py`):**
    1.  **Massive Data Fusion:** The script ingests and integrates over **30 diverse datasets**, including:
        * **Health Data:** Historical Dengue cases from `bangladesh_dengue_cases_2022_2025.csv`.
        * **Environmental Data:** Weather patterns from `dhaka_weather_2022_2025.csv` and VIIRS Nighttime Lights from `dhaka_nightlights_2022_2025.csv`.
        * **Socioeconomic Data:** Detailed census information on population, housing, literacy, and more from the `bangladesh_bbs_population-and-housing-census-dataset_2022` files.
    2.  **Time-Series & Causal Analysis:** It uses **Prophet** for robust time-series decomposition and **Tigramite** for causal discovery to identify time-lagged relationships between variables.
    3.  **Predictive Modeling:** A **LightGBM** model is trained on the fused dataset to make final forecasts.
* **Key Numbers & Outputs (`hawkeye_v4_analysis_report.json`):**
    * **7-Day Forecast Accuracy:** **9.8% Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**.
    * **14-Day Forecast Accuracy:** **12.5% MAPE**.
    * **30-Day Forecast Accuracy:** **17.2% MAPE**.
    * **Key Causal Link Identified:** `Max_Temp` -> `Dengue_Cases` with a **2-week lag**. This is a critical, actionable insight for public health officials.
* **Visual Assets:**
    * **Main Dashboard Visual:** `final flourish/reports_v4/figures/dashboard.png`. This is the hero image, showing the comprehensive forecast, feature importance, and causal links in a single view.
    * **Supporting Visuals:**
        * `final flourish/reports_v4/individual_plots/02_model_validation.png`: Shows the model's predictions plotted against actuals, proving its accuracy.
        * `final flourish/reports_v4/individual_plots/03_forecast_standalone.png`: A clean, forward-looking chart of the 30-day Dengue case forecast.

#### **3.2. Urban Intelligence: GDP Nowcasting with Nighttime Lights**

* **Narrative:** This demo proves the OS can create novel economic indicators. We use satellite-derived nighttime light intensity as a real-time proxy for economic activity, allowing us to "nowcast" GDP with a lag of only weeks, rather than waiting months for official statistics.
* **Methodology:**
    * The same `run_hawkeye_omega_v4_corrected.py` script is used, but focuses on the relationship between the `dhaka_nightlights_2022_2025.csv` data and the historical `bangladesh_economic_indicators_2022_2025.csv` data.
* **Key Numbers & Outputs (`hawkeye_v4_analysis_report.json`):**
    * **Nightlights vs. GDP Correlation:** **0.88**. This extremely high correlation validates nighttime lights as a strong proxy for economic activity.
* **Visual Assets:**
    * **Main Dashboard Visual:** `final flourish/reports_v4/figures/gee_nightlights_2022.png`. This is a powerful, intuitive map showing the economic "glow" of Dhaka at night.
    * **Supporting Visual:** A simple line chart plotting "Nightlight Intensity" against "Quarterly GDP" to visually demonstrate the strong 0.88 correlation.
